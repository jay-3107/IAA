              Indian Aviation Academy (IAA) has constantly endeavoured to empower aviation professionals with knowledge and skill. A full member of ICAO TRAINAIR PLUS PROGRAM (TPP), IAA has collaboration with IATA, ACI,AAAE and many renowned management institutes to foster training activities on global aviation arena. The collaborative pursuit has helped IAA to carve a niche for itself on many national and international platforms. While India is poised to become third largest aviation market in the world very soon, it would require very large pool of trained aviation personnel to meet the industryâ€™s demand. With a team of talented and competent ICAO qualified course developers and instructors, IAA is fully geared up to take on the challenge of bridging the gap between the demand and supply of industry. Having developed five standardized training packages (STPS), the course development unit of IAA is also focusing on upgrading all training packages and benchmarking them in tune with global best practices.
