About IAA
Indian Aviation Academy (IAA), is the joint training academy of the Airports Authority of India (AAI), Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS). Its history can be traced back to year 1986, when the Institute of Airport Management started its operations from Patterson Farm House, located near Indira Gandhi International Airport. The Institute moved to its present campus in 1988. The new building was inaugurated by the Secretary General, ICAO in December, 1988. It was renamed as National Institute of Aviation Management and Research (NIAMAR) in 1997. In 2010, NIAMAR was transformed into the Indian Aviation Academy. The copy of MoU between AAI, DGCA and BCAS is available here .

Vision Statement
Becoming a Global Centre of Excellence in various Aviation related Education, Training and Research activities and in the long run to attain Deemed University status imparting Diploma and Degree courses in the Aviation Field as well as becoming an economically independent entity of International Standard.


Indian Aviation Academy (IAA) has constantly endeavoured to empower aviation professionals with knowledge and skill. A full member of ICAO TRAINAIR PLUS PROGRAM (TPP), IAA has collaboration with IATA, ACI,AAAE and many renowned management institutes to foster training activities on global aviation arena. The collaborative pursuit has helped IAA to carve a niche for itself on many national and international platforms. While India is poised to become third largest aviation market in the world very soon, it would require very large pool of trained aviation personnel to meet the industry’s demand. With a team of talented and competent ICAO qualified course developers and instructors, IAA is fully geared up to take on the challenge of bridging the gap between the demand and supply of industry. Having developed five standardized training packages (STPS), the course development unit of IAA is also focusing on upgrading all training packages and benchmarking them in tune with global best practices. Undoubtedly, the initiative will bear fruits to cater to emerging training requirements of all aviation stakeholders. Contributing to an integrated eco-system which will lead to sustainable growth of aviation and associated sectors will be hallmark of all our activities. By engaging in path-breaking aviation education and training, we will help India earn its pride of place on global horizon. Soliciting support and suggestion from one and all.
